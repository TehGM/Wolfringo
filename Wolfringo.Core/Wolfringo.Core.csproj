    <PackageReleaseNotes>This version features significant amount of changes. Please see upgrade guide: https://wolfringo.tehgm.net/upgrading/1.x-2.x.html

- Added WolfClientBuilder that makes creation of a WolfClient much easier!
- Added support for checking URL metadata.
- Added support for requesting group achievements.
- Added IWolfTokenProvider interface, along with ConstantWolfTokenProvider, RandomizedWolfTokenProvider and HostedWolfTokenProvider classes, which are used by WolfClient. This increases flexibility of resolving token. They replaceWolfTokenProvider.
- Added a new IWolfClientCache interface which allows for cache customization via Dependency Injection.
- Added a new WolfClientCache class with default caching implementation. This replaces old WolfEntityCacheContainer, which is now removed.
- Added a new WolfCacheOptions class for configuring built-in caching.
- Caching related properties have been removed from WolfClient.
- IWolfEntityCache&amp;lt;TEntity&amp;gt; has been renamed to IWolfCachedEntityCollection&amp;lt;TEntity&amp;gt;.
- WolfEntityCacheExtensions has been renamed to WolfCachedEntityCollectionExtensions.
- Caching related types (including IWolfClientCacheAccessor) were moved from TehGM.Wolfringo.Utilities to new TehGM.Wolfringo.Caching namespace.
- DefaultServerURL, BetaServerURL and DefaultDevice constants have been moved from WolfClient to a new WolfClientOptions class.
- ServerURL, Device and IgnoreOwnChatMessages properties of WolfClient have been moved to a new WolfClientOptions class.
- It is now possible to provide a custom ISocketClient to WolfClient.
- WolfClient's OnMessageSentInternalAsync and OnMessageReceivedInternalAsync were renamed to OnMessageSentAsync and OnMessageReceivedAsync respectively. Since caching logic has been moved to IWolfClientCache, they also are now empty, sooverriding them is completely safe.
- UserAchievementListResponse has been replaced by EntityAchievementListResponse, which supports both user and group achievements.
- Some WolfClient constructors were removed or marked as obsolete. Favour using WolfClientBuilder.
- JSON Converters have been modified to support JsonPath.
- "command" argument has been renamed to "eventName" in signatures of built-in message and response serializers.</PackageReleaseNotes>
