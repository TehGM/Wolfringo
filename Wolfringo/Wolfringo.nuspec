    <releaseNotes>
This version features significant amount of changes. Please see upgrade guide: https://wolfringo.tehgm.net/upgrading/1.x-2.x.html

- Added WolfClientBuilder that makes creation of a WolfClient much easier!
- Added CommandsServiceBuilder that makes creation of a CommandsService much easier!
- Added an easy help command support.
- Added {{RecipientID}} and {{RecipientName}} placeholders are now supported in command argument error messages.
- Added [ArgumentText] attribute for command method arguments.
- Added support for checking URL metadata.
- Added support for requesting group achievements.
- Both standard and regex commands now support a timeout.
- Regex commands now support a Regex engine timeout to prevent potential attacks.
- Added an extension method for ChatMessage class: GetMessageWithoutPrefix.
- Added CommandContextOptions class which can now be injected into command method.
- Added CommandRequirementsResult class for use by command requirements.
- Added IWolfTokenProvider interface, along with ConstantWolfTokenProvider, RandomizedWolfTokenProvider and HostedWolfTokenProvider classes, which are used by WolfClient. This increases flexibility of resolving token. They replaceWolfTokenProvider.
- Added a new IWolfClientCache interface which allows for cache customization via Dependency Injection.
- Added a new WolfClientCache class with default caching implementation. This replaces old WolfEntityCacheContainer, which is now removed.
- Added a new WolfCacheOptions class for configuring built-in caching.
- Caching related properties have been removed from WolfClient.
- IWolfEntityCache&lt;TEntity&gt; has been renamed to IWolfCachedEntityCollection&lt;TEntity&gt;.
- WolfEntityCacheExtensions has been renamed to WolfCachedEntityCollectionExtensions.
- Caching related types (including IWolfClientCacheAccessor) were moved from TehGM.Wolfringo.Utilities to new TehGM.Wolfringo.Caching namespace.
- DefaultServerURL, BetaServerURL and DefaultDevice constants have been moved from WolfClient to a new WolfClientOptions class.
- ServerURL, Device and IgnoreOwnChatMessages properties of WolfClient have been moved to a new WolfClientOptions class.
- It is now possible to provide a custom ISocketClient to WolfClient.
- WolfClient's OnMessageSentInternalAsync and OnMessageReceivedInternalAsync were renamed to OnMessageSentAsync and OnMessageReceivedAsync respectively. Since caching logic has been moved to IWolfClientCache, they also are now empty, sooverriding them is completely safe.
- UserAchievementListResponse has been replaced by EntityAchievementListResponse, which supports both user and group achievements.
- Sender utility now returns achievements with nullable timestamps. This is due to how WOLF server handles them.
- Command requirements' CheckAsync method now returns ICommandResult instead of a boolean. Supporting AbortOnFail and SendMessageWhenSkipping properties and ResultFromBoolean method were added to CommandRequirementAttribute class.
- StandardCommandInstance and RegexCommandInstance now inherit from a shared CommandInstanceBase class.
- CommandsOptions now implement a new ICommandOptions interface.
- Some WolfClient constructors were removed or marked as obsolete. Favour using WolfClientBuilder.
- Some CommandsService constructors were removed or marked as obsolete. Favour using CommandsServiceBuilder.
- Types implementing ICommandResult are now classes instead of structs.
- IsSuccess property of ICommandResult is now obsolete. Favour using Status property.
- Exception property has been removed from most of classes implementing ICommandResult.
- ErrorMessage property of ICommandRequirement has been removed. It is still present in CommandRequirementAttribute, so existing error messages should still work just fine.
- ICommandsService now has Commands property, containing all instance descriptors currently active within the service.
- SimpleServiceProvider and CombinedServiceProvider classes were removed, as they're no longer needed internally.
- CommandInstanceDescriptorExtensions class has been moved from TehGM.Wolfringo.Commands.Initialization to TehGM.Wolfringo.Commands namespace.
- Command instance descriptor extension methods now use new internal attribute cache class DescriptorAttributeCache. This cache uses lazy reflection for performance.
- Priority property of CommandInstanceDescriptor has been removed. Favour using extension methods.
- JSON Converters have been modified to support JsonPath.
- "command" argument has been renamed to "eventName" in signatures of built-in message and response serializers.
- Constructor of HostedWolfClient has been simplified.
- IHostedWolfClientServiceBuilder now has a new ConfigureCaching method.
- Requesting specific achievements has been optimized, which should result in a slightly reduced network usage.
- Dependency Injection mechanisms for Commands now correctly differentiate between argument with default value and optional argument.
- Some Sender methods were not configuring await properly. This is now fixed.
